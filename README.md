## malloc implementation


#### üí£ State: Upgrading the library for properly work with ```mmap```.

**Current version** :

- ‚úÖ supports creation of small memory blocks (***sbrk()***)
- ‚úÖ includes ***free()*** module
- ‚úÖ linked-blocks structure (close to glibc malloc implementation)
- ‚ùå support of big memory blocks (mmap)

---
Folder main structure:

```
/mymalloc/library    # contains versions of library
/mymalloc/main       # test module
```
To bulid a shared library:
```
gcc -shared -fPIC -o malloc2.so malloc2.c
```
To include it into your project:
```
 LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/library/malloc2.so ./main
```
